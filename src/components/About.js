                      Hello! My name is Emerson Albert and I'm a Full-stack developer. I was born and raised in Miami,
                       Florida, the home to beautiful beaches, nightlife, and sunshine every day. I am looking to dive deeper
                        into web development and eventually merge into software engineering. My story starts at the University
                         of Central Florida, where I began diving into the endless world of coding. The more lines I type and
                          the more knowledge I accumulated the more my passion grew. The ability to create something from your
                           imagination alone is immensely powerful and as a coder I can do that with just a couple of keystrokes.
                            I value being able to bring my visions to life and create something from nothing. This allows me to
                             bring out my creativity and brainstorm all the different ways you can express one specific idea or
                              tackle one set problem. This perfect blend of problem-solving and creativity drew me to coding in
                               the first place. I love being able to dissect a problem and figure out different ways to express
                                an idea. Utilizing Bootstrap and CSS3 allows creative freedom and variety, making me a well-rounded
                                 developer. I take pride in learning every aspect of a program and seeing how it all interacts with
                                  one another. This is my reasoning for specializing in the MERN stack. Each of these components 
                                  coming together to make a beautiful application is optimization at its best. Being proficient with
                                   these programs and frameworks allows me to master my craft and create optimal projects for my clients.

                        Outside of sitting in front of my laptop, I enjoy playing basketball and video games competitively.
                         Basketball doesn't just allow me to stay in shape physically but also pushes me to gain better collaboration skills
                          and utilize teamwork to efficiently get to a shared end goal. Everyone on the team must come together and make use
                           of their individual strengths and skills that will push us to victory, similarly to coding. The same goes for video
                            games except it has an extra layer of admiration because each game I play is produced from code. It started as an
                             idea until a group came together to create a fully functioning and responsive program for me and many others to share.
                              It allowed us to do something fun with our free time, build communities and friendships, and ultimately connect groups
                               of people with shared interests. It is exciting to think that one day I will also be able to share my work with the
                                world and have plenty of people who utilize and love it just as much as I do. I am excited to create and bring my ideas
                                 to life. Please feel free to reach out to me for any inquiries and collaborations! I like to learn from people and
                                  improve every single day. I am a friend you can talk to if you need one and a supporter you never knew you had.
                                   Hope to hear from you soon!
