                        My name is Emerson Albert! Don't forget it, I might be important to
                        you one day. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. Where you can
                        experience all four seasons in one day and the nightlife never
                        stops. I'm on my way to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer but the
                        main goal is to be a Software Engineer.

                        My story starts at the University of Central Florida, where I began
                        diving into the world of coding. The more lines I typed, the
                        stronger the passion grew. The ability to create something from just
                        your imagination is very powerful and we as coders are able to do
                        that with just a couple of keystrokes. I am honored to be apart of
                        any team or client that I will be representing. Lets get to work!

                        Outside of sitting in front of my laptop, I like to play basketball
                        and play video games. I don't mind schooling someone on the court or
                        online. Both of these hobbies taught be how to perfect my craft and
                        to utilize teamwork and thats that I strive to show in the content
                        that I produce.
